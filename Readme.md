## 🎯 The Problem

Cross-chain intent transactions are complex multi-step operations that can fail at any stage—bridging, executing, or swapping—across different blockchains. Currently, developers and users face:

- **Zero visibility** into intent lifecycle stages when transactions fail
- **No debugging tools** to understand why a Bridge & Execute or XCS Swap failed
- **Manual tracking** across multiple block explorers for different chains
- **No AI accessibility** for automated failure analysis and retry suggestions

The [ERC-7683 Cross-Chain Intents Standard](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7683-cross-chain-intents-standard/19619) discussions highlight 45+ cross-chain vulnerabilities, yet no unified monitoring infrastructure exists.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Cross-Chain Intent Explorer** is the first infrastructure-level tool that:

✅ **Indexes intent events** from Avail Nexus SDK across 10+ EVM chains  
✅ **Tracks multi-step lifecycles** in real-time (lock → bridge → execute)  
✅ **Provides AI-powered debugging** via Blockscout MCP endpoints  
✅ **Visualizes failure points** with interactive flow diagrams  
✅ **Exposes developer APIs** for programmatic intent monitoring

## 🏗️ Architecture


### Core Components

#### 1. **Envio HyperIndex** (Multi-Chain Data Layer)
- Monitors Avail Nexus SDK events across Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon, and more
- Captures intent lifecycle events:
  - `BRIDGE_EXECUTE_EXPECTED_STEPS`
  - `BRIDGE_EXECUTE_COMPLETED_STEPS`
  - `EXPECTED_STEPS`
  - `STEP_COMPLETE`
- Processes 5,000+ events/second with sub-second latency
- GraphQL API for querying intent history

#### 2. **Blockscout MCP Server** (AI-Accessible Layer)
- Custom plugin architecture for intent-specific queries
- MCP Tools:
  - `getIntentStatus(intentId)` - Fetch real-time intent state
  - `getIntentHistory(address)` - List all intents by wallet
  - `analyzeFailedIntent(intentId)` - AI-powered failure diagnosis
- Enables AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Gemini) to query blockchain data

#### 3. **Next.js Frontend** (Developer Interface)
- Search by wallet address, transaction hash, or intent ID
- Interactive Sankey diagrams showing fund flow across chains
- Timeline view of intent execution steps
- Embedded AI assistant for natural language queries
- Real-time notifications for intent status changes

#### 4. **AI Analysis Engine**
- Connects Blockscout MCP endpoints to LLM (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Pre-trained on Avail Nexus SDK event schemas
- Provides:
  - Root cause analysis for failures
  - Gas optimization suggestions
  - Retry recommendations with adjusted parameters

## 🎨 Key Features

### 🔎 **Intent Lifecycle Tracking**
Monitor every step of your cross-chain transactions:
Source Chain (Lock) → Bridge Transfer → Destination Chain (Execute)
✓ ✓ ❌ Failed


### 🤖 **AI-Powered Debugging**
Ask natural language questions:
- *"Why did my Ethereum → Arbitrum bridge fail at step 3?"*
- *"Show all failed intents from my wallet in the last 24 hours"*
- *"What gas price should I use to avoid this error?"*

### 📊 **Multi-Chain Dashboard**
Unified view across:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Optimism
- Arbitrum
- Base
- Polygon
- Avalanche
- Scroll
- Linea
- Mantle
- Hyperliquid

### 🔗 **Developer API**

// Query intent status
const status = await explorer.getIntent("0x123...");

// Analyze failure
const analysis = await explorer.analyzeFailure("0x123...");
// Returns: { reason: "Slippage exceeded", suggestion: "Increase to 1.5%" }

## 🔬 Why This Matters

### The Cross-Chain Intent Gap
According to research on blockchain interoperability security (SoK 2024), there are **45 documented cross-chain vulnerabilities** and **92 mitigation strategies**, yet developers lack real-time monitoring tools to implement these mitigations effectively.

### Market Validation
- **OneBalance** and **Circle's Unified API** prove demand for cross-chain aggregation
- **Range Explorer** shows users want unified views, but none support intent lifecycles
- **AI Agents in DeFi** article (TowardsAI, Jan 2025) identifies unified liquidity views as the missing link in DeFi's $100B liquidity challenge

### Technical Innovation
- **First intent-centric explorer** vs. existing token/transfer focus
- **Open-source infrastructure** vs. closed commercial APIs
- **AI-accessible endpoints** enabling the next generation of autonomous agents
- **Real-time multi-chain indexing** with sub-second latency
