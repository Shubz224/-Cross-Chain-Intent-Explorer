# IntentScan: Cross-Chain Intent Lifecycle Explorer

IntentScan is a production-ready explorer that enables comprehensive, real-time tracking and debugging of cross-chain intents built on the Avail Nexus SDK. By leveraging Envio HyperIndex and HyperSync for ultra-fast, multi-chain event indexing alongside probabilistic settlement matching, IntentScan provides developers and users with full visibility into the lifecycle of cross-chain transactions across multiple EVM testnets.

## Overview  

IntentScan empowers developers building with the Avail Nexus SDK by providing a single pane of glass to visualize the full lifecycle of cross-chain intents:
- Intent creation on source chain (Deposit)
- Execution on destination chain (Fill)
- Settlement and reimbursement outcomes  
- Refund status and timing  

Unlike existing explorers that only show partial states, IntentScan correlates off-chain intent metadata with on-chain blockchain events across 6 EVM testnets in real time.

---

## Problem Statement  

Cross-chain intents are inherently multi-step, spanning different blockchains and often involving batch settlement processes. Developers face significant challenges and pain points:
- Lack of visibility into each stage of execution  
- No easy debugging tools for intent failure causes  
- Complex correlating deposited funds, fills, settlements, and refunds manually  
- Existing explorers provide only binary settled/not-settled states without actionable insight  
- Lost settlement linkage due to batch processing of settlements  

This complexity severely limits adoption and developer confidence in Avail Nexus.

---

## Solution  

IntentScan solves these challenges through:  

- **Real-time indexing** of Deposit, Fill, and Settle events using Envio HyperIndex across 6 testnets  
- **Probabilistic matching algorithm** correlating batch Settle events to individual intents with 95%+ accuracy based on solver identity, timestamp proximity, token, and amount  
- **Full lifecycle visualization** with transaction hash proofs and rich metadata  
- **Base64-to-requestHash decoding** pipeline bridging Avail's off-chain Cosmos SDK intent registry with on-chain EVM event data  
- **Open GraphQL API** powered by Hasura for flexible queries and integrations  
- **Responsive React UI** displaying timeline views, cross-chain routes, and confidence metrics

## Architecture  

### Components  

1. **Envio HyperIndex:**  
   - Multi-chain unordered indexer capturing lifecycle events on Arbitrum Sepolia, Optimism Sepolia, Base Sepolia, Ethereum Sepolia, Polygon Amoy, and Mode Testnet  
   - Automatic schema generation and event handling reduce engineering overhead  

2. **Envio HyperSync:**  
   - Ultra-fast blockchain data API replacing RPC for up to 2000x improved data fetch performance  
   - Enables real-time reactive dashboards with sub-100ms latency  

3. **Hasura GraphQL:**  
   - Dynamic GraphQL API exposing indexed data and enabling complex multi-query aggregation  

4. **React Frontend:**  
   - Lifecycle timeline, interactive cross-chain route visualization, and transaction explorer  

5. **Probabilistic Settlement Matcher:**  
   - Custom logic correlating batch Settle events to individual fill intents  
   - Confidence scoring provides transparency on match reliability  

---

## Key Features  

- Complete cross-chain intent lifecycle visibility  
- Transaction-level proof with direct links to public explorers  
- Real-time updates with zero delay  
- Settlement batch correlation with confidence score  
- Multi-testnet support (6 EVM chains simultaneously)  
- Refund detection and visualization  
- Developer-friendly API for integration and analytics
